## The Evidence Workflow (Detailed)

### What Happens for Each Evidence Slot

**Example: You need to prove "92% of officers keep their jobs"**

#### 1. AI Identifies Need
```
"Your claim: '92% of officers keep their jobs after misconduct'

This needs:
- Official data source
- Statistical verification
- Clear methodology
- Target quality: B1 (Official Data)

What do you have for this?"
```

#### 2. You Respond

**Option A - You have it:**
```
You: "I have a FOIL dataset with 20 years of cases"
AI: "Perfect! Please provide the file path or share the data."
```

**Option B - You need help:**
```
You: "I don't have this yet"
AI: "Let's search. We should look for:
- FOIL datasets from corrections department
- Oversight agency reports
- Academic analyses of discipline data
Which should we try first?"
```

#### 3. AI Processes Source

**If PDF:**
- Saves to `Sources/Government/PDFs/`
- Extracts text
- Saves to `Sources/Government/Extracted/`
- Creates summary in `Sources/Summaries/`

**If Data:**
- Saves to `Sources/Data/`
- Documents source and methodology
- Notes any analysis needed

**If Web:**
- Saves content
- Creates summary with quotes
- Notes URL and access date

#### 4. Quality Assessment

```
AI: "Let's score this source:

Questions:
- Is this official data? Yes - FOIL dataset
- Is it verified? Yes - Government provided
- Is methodology clear? Yes - All cases documented
- Can others access? Yes - Public record

Score: B1 (Official Government Data)
Confidence: High"
```

#### 5. Evidence Slot Filled

```
AI updates Argument_Map.md:

> **Evidence:** ✅ B1 (Official data, confirmed)
>
> **Source:** NYCLU DOCCS Misconduct Database (2000-2020)
> - **URL:** [dataset URL]
> - **Local:** /Sources/Data/nyclu_misconduct.csv
> - **Records:** 9,805 cases
>
> **Finding:** 92.1% retention rate
> - 542 terminations out of 5,893 proposed
> - Verified through arbitration records
>
> **Methodology:** Direct calculation from database
```

#### 6. Documentation Updated

```
AI updates:
- Evidence/EVIDENCE_SUMMARY.md (adds entry)
- Evidence/By_Quality/B1_Sources.md (adds source)
- Evidence/By_Section/Part_II_evidence.md (links evidence)
- Research_Process.md (documents finding)
- Evidence/GAPS.md (marks slot complete)
```

#### 7. Ready for Next

```
AI: "✅ Evidence slot filled for 92% retention claim

Next slot: '83% avoid criminal charges'
Ready to continue?"
```

**This loop repeats for every evidence slot**

## Evidence Quality Guide

### Understanding the Scoring System

**A1 - Government/Legal Primary Sources**
- Best for: Legal arguments, policy work
- Examples: Statutes, court decisions, government reports
- Why strong: Official, authoritative, legally binding

**B1 - Official Data/Verified Statistics**
- Best for: Empirical claims, statistical arguments
- Examples: Government databases, FOIL data, audit reports
- Why strong: Verifiable, comprehensive, objective

**C1 - Credentialed Sources**
- Best for: Context, expert opinion, analysis
- Examples: Peer-reviewed research, established journalism
- Why strong: Professional standards, editorial process

**D1 - Advocacy with Verification**
- Best for: Supplementary evidence, lived experience
- Examples: NGO reports with FOIL data, documented investigations
- Why strong: Verified data, transparent methodology

### When Is Evidence "Good Enough"?

**For Academic Publication:**
- Aim for 60%+ A1/B1
- C1 acceptable for context
- All sources peer-review quality

**For Legal Briefing:**
- Aim for 75%+ A1/B1
- Must withstand opposing counsel
- All sources admissible

**For Policy Advocacy:**
- Aim for 70%+ A1/B1
- Must convince skeptics
- All sources verifiable

**For Public Communication:**
- Mix is acceptable
- Prioritize accessibility
- All sources traceable
