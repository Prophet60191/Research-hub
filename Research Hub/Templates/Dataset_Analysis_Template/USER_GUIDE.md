## Example Walkthrough

### Starting a New Project

**1. You:** "I want to analyze police misconduct data"

**AI:** "Great! Let me help you set up a professional project. I'll need some information:
- What should we name this project?
- What's your main research question?
- Where is your data from?"

**2. You provide details**

**3. AI creates:**
```
Police_Misconduct_Analysis/
├── README.md ✅
├── Requirements.txt ✅
├── Docs/ ✅
│   └── [9 documentation files]
├── Data/ ✅
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── reference/
├── Scripts/ ✅
│   ├── Config.py
│   └── Analysis/
├── Outputs/ ✅
└── Database/ ✅
```

**4. AI guides you:** "I've created the structure. Now let's document your data source. Can you tell me..."

**5. You continue working with AI through each phase**

**6. Result:** Complete, professional research project
