### Writing Style

**What rhetorical approach do you want to use? (Select primary, can combine):**

- [ ] **Narrative** - Tell a story, use examples and cases to build argument
- [ ] **Analytical** - Break down systems, show how parts work, logical progression
- [ ] **Persuasive/Advocacy** - Direct argument, call to action, emotional appeal
- [ ] **Expository/Educational** - Explain and inform, neutral presentation
- [ ] **Comparative** - Show contrasts, use before/after or X vs Y structure
- [ ] **Not sure** - Help me choose based on my audience and goals

**Why this style fits (or what you're unsure about):**
> [Explain your thinking or what guidance you need]

---

### Writing Voice & Tone

**How formal should the writing be?**

- [ ] **Highly formal** - Academic/legal language, third person, technical precision
- [ ] **Professional** - Clear and authoritative but accessible
- [ ] **Accessible** - Readable by general public while maintaining rigor
- [ ] **Mixed** - Formal evidence, accessible interpretation
- [ ] **Not sure** - Recommend based on my audience

**What tone do you want?**

- [ ] **Dispassionate/Neutral** - Just the facts, let evidence speak
- [ ] **Measured critique** - Critical but professional
- [ ] **Advocacy** - Passionate but evidence-backed
- [ ] **Educational** - Patient explanation, building understanding
- [ ] **Other:** [Describe]

---

### Structural Approach

**How do you want to structure your argument? (See options):**

**Linear/Chronological:**
- Build argument step by step
- Each section leads to next
- Good for: Causal arguments, historical analysis

**Thematic:**
- Organize by themes or topics
- Each theme proved independently
- Good for: Complex systems, multi-faceted arguments

**Case Study:**
- Start with specific example(s)
- Expand to broader pattern
- Good for: Proving systemic issues

**Problem → Evidence → Solution:**
- Identify problem
- Prove it with evidence
- Propose solutions
- Good for: Policy arguments, advocacy

**Exception Proves Rule:**
- Present normal pattern
- Show exception
- Explain why exception proves the rule
- Good for: Systemic analysis (like your current Argument Map!)

**Comparative:**
- Compare two systems/approaches
- Show differences and implications
- Good for: Reform arguments, alternatives

**Your preferred structure:**
> [Choose from above or describe your own approach]
>
> Example: "Start with shocking case (Brooks), then prove it's system-wide"

---

### Rhetorical Devices & Techniques

**Do you want to use any framing devices or metaphors?**

**Common options:**

**Visual Metaphors:**
- The funnel (accountability narrows at each stage)
- The shield (system protects)
- The maze (complexity obscures)
- The machine (designed with purpose)

**Frameworks:**
- Three-part structure (thesis, antithesis, synthesis)
- Seven tests / Multiple criteria framework
- Layered defense / Multiple barriers
- Before and after / With and without comparison

**Narrative Techniques:**
- Follow one case through entire system
- Contrast typical case with exception
- Day in the life
- What if? / Counterfactual

**Do you want to use a specific device?**
> [Describe or write "No specific device" or "Help me choose"]

**Example from current work:**
> Your Argument Map uses "The Accountability Funnel" - visual metaphor showing how cases get filtered out at each stage. Very effective for showing systematic protection.
